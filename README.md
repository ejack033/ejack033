## About This Profile:
I am Ethan Jackson, and this is my student account for Old Dominion University. I created this README for CS 315 in February 2025. If you are reading this, then you probably have seen an introduction post of mine already. As a purely online student, I am usually required to write at least one of these at the start of every semester. For general information about me that is up-to-date, please refer to my most recent introduction post. If you do not have access to any of my introduction posts, or have other questions that my post did not answer, then you can contact me through the Canvas inbox system (preferred), [my student email](ejack033@odu.edu), or any other communication channel we've established.
